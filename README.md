# 🏓 pong

This is my version of the classic **Pong Game**. 

This game was created using the [Turtle Module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html) 🐢 and [Python](https://www.python.org/about/gettingstarted/) 🐍.

**Pong** is a two player game. 🤼‍♀️

Each player has a paddle. 🏓 The paddle moves up and down.

The object of the game is to keep the ball from hitting the wall. 💥 You do this by moving your paddle.

If you move your paddle in the way, the ball will bounce off your paddle. 

If the other player misses the ball. You gain a point. 🏆

 🎈**The player with the most points wins!** 🎈

Player 1: Use the **A** key to move your paddle up and use the **Z** key to move your paddle down.

Player 2: Use the ⬆️ key to move your paddle up and use the ⬇️ key to move your paddle down.

**This is a simple, but very fun game to play! Enjoy!** 🏓
